# Referee-Watch
Beschreibung

*** Coming soon: Summary page when the match ended where it's possible to see the times of all halfs (and extra halfs) and the end time. ***

This is an enhancement of https://apps.garmin.com/de-DE/apps/280d96cd-92f7-4b10-b665-f067a5ba788c from Gofasterdjh and his code from GitHub.

It has GPS functionality, Activity recording and multiple halfs.

For soccer referees it is possible to add possible extra time (5, 10 or 15 minutes) after half 2 for cup games.

The big timer in the middle always counts up. The timer at the upper half counts down from the predefined time. It stops if the enter button is pressed. If the upper timer stopped, a third timer appears at the bottom, which indicates the "paused time".

The bottom left and right indicates the selected extra time if its turned on.

As I am not able to test other devices than the Vivoactive, feel free to contact me for any issues or feature requests.
